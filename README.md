# readme-generator

## Description

This is a Node.js command-line application that asks the user a series of prompts about the project they would like to generate a README for. The prompt answers will be used to generate a README file with proper markdown as well as a LICENSE file.

This application serves to save time for the user by providing a user with a README with proper markdown based on the user's input. The user then can use the README out of the box or customize it further to fit their needs.

The purpose of this project was to practice writing command-line applications in javascript.
